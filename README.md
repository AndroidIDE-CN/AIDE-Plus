# AIDE-Plus

因为懂的都懂的原因，现将AIDE Plus源码闭源，不在开源，这个仓库以后只用来发布新版本。

# 补充
因为发现有人不遵守AGPL协议，因此所有作者一致决定闭源。我当初也只是让所有对AIDE有兴趣的人可以定制自己的AIDE，但是使用本项目源码，却不遵守AGPL协议且使用加壳技术，让我放弃分享了。
不会影响后续版本的推送。

Because it was discovered that someone did not comply with the AGPL protocol,all authors have unanimously decided to close the source code. My original intention was to allow anyone interested in AIDE to customize their own version, but some users utilized this project's source code without adhering to the AGPL license and even packed the software with protective shells. This has led me to abandon further code sharing. This decision will not affect subsequent version updates.
